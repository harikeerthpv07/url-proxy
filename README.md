TECHs used:

REACT, MONGO DB, EXPRESS JS, NODE JS


WHY DID I COME UP WITH THIS:

Idea of this project came to my mind, when my college HOD has sent some google drive link(not sure if it was google drive link specifically, but that link was sooo long, lines and lines) into the class group.
while I was copying that long link, last line was missed out, it took couple of tries to copy that long link, though its not that big issue to deal with it was little annoying, but then I felt like as a responsible 
andd aspiring future software developer/full stack developer I thought how to solve that problem and I came up with this, this was entirely coded by me, few theoretical part I got help from chatgpt, and yeah yeah also
in debugging and typos, I got help from chatgpt, other than that the entire code is written by me. If the code is not that good or if you can give suggestion or anything please

MY FUTURE PLANS:

AUTH CHECK: I havent integrated any auth check for this yet, (I have done it in my chat app, so I have an idea of how to implement it, I might in future), 
so it can be used unlimitedly(ofcourse unlimitedly= my free tier mongodb storage ðŸ˜‚)

QR code: planning to  implement qr code generation for the shortened

Use IP address: pie chart or some bar graph or some sort of graph, which displays geographical locations and counts from each locations
